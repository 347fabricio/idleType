Well, that's an **idle game** a bit different from the others. To earn coins, you have to type. With your coins, you can buy upgrades that'll earn you more and more coins.

I'd want to create a game similar to Cookie Clicker, but not the same, it was when I had the idea to create a game on which you have to type to earn coins.

My idea is to create the game using basically **raw JavaScript**, maybe later I'll use something to add to it.

I'm not an experienced programmer, I'm learning a lot of making these things. If you want to contribute with something, all the reviews are welcome.

Thanks for reading!
